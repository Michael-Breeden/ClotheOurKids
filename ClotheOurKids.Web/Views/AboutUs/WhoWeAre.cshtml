        <!--Section description-->
        <p class="section-description text-left">
            Clothe Our Kids of North Alabama was founded by Michael and Brandi Breeden in April of 2016. 
            When moving back home to Alabama after living in Tennessee for 3 years both felt a calling to do more in their community. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-description text-left">
            After hearing about a Clothe Our Kids operating in Lincoln County, TN they met with founder Laura Meyer and learned how they operated and served the children in their community.
            They saw that Morgan County had a gap for providing clothing to children within the school systems who are in need.
            Michael and Brandi went straight to work to form the organization previously known as Clothe Our Kids of Morgan County.
        </p>

        <p class="section-description text-left">
            Michael and Brandi reside in Priceville, AL and have two children, Jeremiah and Bella. They are members of Lifepoint Church in Decatur, AL.
